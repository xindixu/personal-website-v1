    <h1>Welcome to Shih's Group</h1>

    <p>The Shih Group’s research activities center around the theme of quantum control of condensed matter systems.   It seeks to develop the ability to engineer materials with atomic precision, thus enabling one to control system dimensionalities at different length scales.  Of interest to the group are those length scales at which the interplay of electronic, photonic and spin degrees of freedom result in novel material properties; in this sense, the group’s work deals with the core intellectual context of nanoscience and nanotechnology.</p>
