	<h1>Groovy Automotive - Media Strategy</h1>
	<div class="content" id="item-1">
		<h2>Project Description</h2>
		<p>This is a hypothetical media planning project for Austin local brand, Groovy Automotive. </p>
		<p>Groovy Automotive has been serving up fun, reliable, and reasonable auto services as the "honest, neighborhood garage" since 1993. Recently, they have been decided to take their story on the road and launch an experimental store in Colorado Springs, CO, a city synonymous with the ideas and persona of "groovy". </p>
		<div id="item-1-1">
			<h3>Objectives</h3>
			<div class="text-center"> <img class="img-fluid" src="image/major/groovy/groovy01.png" alt="objectives" width="100%"/> </div>
		</div>

		<p>Just as other professional media agencies, we, Agency6, started with conducting a significant amount of primary and secondary research. This benefits us a lot in terms of understanding our brand, its competitors, as well as local market and potential trade area. </p>
		<p>It is the research, that grant us creativity</p>
	</div>
	<div class="content" id="item-2-1">
		<h3>Our Process</h3>
		<p>We first distributed tasks among our 6 people. Kaci, Alejandro, and I were responsible for the target market and geographic profile, competitive profile and product &amp; brand variables respectively. These four parts made up our situation analysis. </p>
		<p>Then, we all explored on media menu. Finally, Regina put everything together in PowerPoint, and make it neat and stylish. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="content" id="item-2-1-1">
		<h5>Target Market</h5>
		<div class="text-center"> <img class="img-fluid" src="image/major/groovy/groovy03.png" alt="target market" width="100%"/> </div>
	</div>
	<div class="content" id="item-2-1-2">
		<h5>Geographic Profile</h5>
		<div class="text-center"> <img class="img-fluid" src="image/major/groovy/groovy04.png" alt="geographic profile" width="100%"/> </div>
	</div>
	<div class="content" id="item-2-2">
		<h3>My Contribution</h3>
		<div class="content" id="item-2-2-1">
			<h5>Product &amp; Brand Variables</h5>
			<div class="text-center"> <img class="img-fluid" src="image/major/groovy/groovy02.png" alt="brand variables" width="100%"/></div>
			<p>I first started with researching on Groovy's website familiarized myself with our brand and product. Then I went to Groovy's Facebook, Yelp, YouTube channel, Groupon, etc for more information. With my research, I came up with three keywords for Groovy: Highest Quality, Friendly, and Local.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="content" id="item-2-2-2">
			<h5>Media Menu</h5>
			<div class="text-center"> <img class="img-fluid" src="image/major/groovy/groovy05.png" alt="media menu" width="100%"/></div>
			<p>Then, only after Kaci settled down our target audience and geographic profile, could I start with our <a class="tlp" data-toggle="tooltip" title="A summary of cost vs. benefit for all media choices" data-placement="bottom">media menu</a>. After a few hours of exploration, I finally learned how to navigate <a class="tlp" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Standard Rate & Data Services" data-placement="bottom">SRDS</a> database. In that database, I found:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><a class="tlp" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Cost per Point, how much it costs to buy 1 rating point or 1% of the target population" data-placement="bottom">CPP</a> for local TV and Radio from <a class="tlp" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Standard Quality & Advertsing Data" data-placement="bottom">SQAD</a></li>
				<li>Circulation and Ad rates for local newspaper and magazine in our <a class="tlp" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Designated Market Area, a market where the population can receive the same TV and radio station offerings" data-placement="bottom">DMA</a> from <a class="tlp" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Alliance for Audited Media" data-placement="bottom">AAA</a>, with a special focus on zipcode 80904 </li>
				<li>Display Ad audience metrics &amp; <a class="tlp" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Cost per Thousand, the price of 1,000 ad impressions on 1 webpage" data-placement="bottom">CPM</a> for local &amp; nearby DMA websites from comScore, with a special focus on measuring visitors aged 25-34, 45-54, and 65+.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With Google Adwords, I worked with Regina, first coming up with ideas on various groups of keywords. Then, we entered them into Keyword Planner, set bid to $3.00, and exported data on clicks, impression, cost, <a class="tlp" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Click through Rate, ratio of clicks v. impressions" data-placement="bottom">CTR</a>, Avg <a class="tlp" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Cost per Click" data-placement="bottom">CPC</a>, etc.</p>
			<p>On Blue Line Media website, Alejandro and I searched for various <a class="tlp" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Out of Home" data-placement="bottom">OOH</a> media placements, collecting data their potential <a class="tlp" data-toggle="tooltip" title="How many people could see the ad everyday" data-placement="bottom">showings</a> and costs. </p>

		<h3>Hand</h3>
		<p>Delena was good at making artistic designs, while I was good at making incremental innovations. Basically, after we presented on Monday, we would discuss the next steps, based on suggestions, feedbacks, field-notes from classmates, performers, our director, and designer. Then, we would both work on editing the file in Illustrator, and I would go to the foundry and laser cut those wood pieces before Wednesday. After that, we would go paint those pieces, and I would assemble everything together. Delena made most of the gloves, and she has done a great job on sewing. </p>
		<p>Then, we all explored on media menu. Finally, Regina put everything together in PowerPoint, and make it neat and stylish. </p>

	<div id="item-3-2">
		<h3>Claws</h3>
		<p> At the middle of the semester, one of our classmates dropped the course, so we took over with making teeth and claws. I designed the 3D model in Maya, and cut it into two different lengths for teeth and claws. Then, I learned 3D printing process and started 3D printing. It was a very time-consuming process, and I am very thankful that our classmates contributed their time in monitoring the printer for us. </p>
	</div>
	<div id="item-3-3">
		<h3>Lights</h3>
		<p>During the final weeks, I jumped into the electric team, helping them to solder the central shields for lighting effects, and making the LED stripes, and EL wires. Since they were lack of people to meet the deadline, we worked very hard, late until 2 am, and all weekends. On Friday, few days before the unleashing date, we found a severe design problem: the LED stripes should be connected in parallel, to ensure the flow direction and enough voltage flowing through. With our hard work, thankfully, we got everything to work on the unleashing event. </p>
